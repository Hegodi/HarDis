Basic molecular dynamics simulations based on hard disks (2D).
It uses hard spheres model (hard disks in 2D) with a time-driven 
algorithm.




Executable:  Hardis.jar is ready to be executed in a devide with
             java installed.

Compilation: to compile from the source code:
           - Go to src/
           - type "make". This will generated the *.class files in 
             the class folder.
           - Go to root folder and execute: "sh MakeJar.b" 
           - Then the file Hardis.har should be created in the 
             same folder.
